         <h2>Who Are We</h2>

         <p> The first Filipino student group at the UW was the Filipino Club, established in 1917 by pensionados (Filipino students whose American education was subsidized by the US government). Since then, the idea of a community and forum for Filipino and Filipino American students has remained, although the name has not. FASA as it is today is the evolution and culmination of all of the different Filipino/Filipino American student groups at the UW, such as the Filipino Student Association, Filipino Literary Club, Filipino Alumni Association, Coalition of Filipinos for Equal Education, and others. FASA is a safe space for Filipino students and those interested in Filipino culture and history to express themselves, be themselves, and have support in this large and demanding university. </p>

         <h2> Our 4 Pillars </h2>

         <ul>
            <li>
               <b> Educational Pillar </b> is instilled upon current UW and high school students active in the Filipino and Filipino American community through programs such as Project F.A.M.I.L.Y (a high school outreach program), setting up quarterly study tables during finals week, and more. As an organization and with the guidance of our academics chair, we support each other to maintain academic excellence.
            </li>

            <li>
               <b> Political Pillar </b> is instilled in our organization by encouraging awareness of the issues happening at a local, national, and international level. With our political chair as our liaison, the organization is a part of Kabataan Alliance (a national alliance of Filipino youth and student organizations dedicated to serving our communities here and back in the Philippines), ASUW Senate, and more
            </li>

            <li>
               <b> Cultural Pillar </b> is instilled in our community through Sayaw (our traditional dance troupe), Filipino Night, workshops, and discussions during our general meetings. Through our cultural chair, sayaw coordinator, and historian chair, we aim for appreciation towards our cultural heritage.

            </li>

            <li>
               <b> Social Pillar </b> is instilled by providing a space for our community to enjoy themselves in the company of our organization. Our activities chair aims to bring the community together starting in the summer through FASA shores, FASA All-Stars, FASA Formal, and many more. Through our social pillar, we encourage students to take time to self-care during their college career.
            </li>

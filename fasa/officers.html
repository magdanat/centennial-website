                      I choose to become President during such a monumental year because I am determined to weave purpose and meaning into everything this organization executes its programming and events. Furthermore, being President doesn't mean I determine every single action FASA sa UW takes, rather it is my duty to cultivate an environment where officers and members utilize their cultural background as platform for leadership and success. Through this term I, alongside my officer board will make sure that our history is told and that the legacy of Filipino of Organizations inspires positive change within our community.

                     I chose to take on this opportunity for a few reasons. First, I missed the officer life and how much fun it was to serve the community and our members. Second, I wanted to step up to be able to use this year as a way of honoring our ancestors and surrounding community at UW and the impact they had in the development of UW and the shaping of what the Filipino identity is today. Lastly, I chose to take on the task because I wanted to give back to the community that welcomed me in, gave me a second home, and made me realize how important it is to know your heritage. As a returning officer, I look forward to what we can accomplish on such a momentous year ahead.

The people. FASA brings in people of all backgrounds, those who identify as Filipino, and those who identify as Filipino American. Each individual has something new to offer when they step into the space that FASA holds, and I love learning about each individuals' story that makes them who they are. Without a strong membership, I don't know where FASA would be today, or if I would have even been so inspired by our members to serve as an officer for a second time.

I chose to become an officer for this school year because I really wanted to give back to the community that gave me so much the past two years. I know there are some people that would say I've already done so much for FASA, but as a member, it honestly doesn't feel like work. I'm not saying that members aren't vital to the work that we do as an organization, rather, I'm saying that as a member, you don't really get to appreciate the hard work that officers do behind the scenes to simply organize and execute something as simple as a general meeting or a Filipino Night rehearsal. </li>

I kept coming back to FASA simply because of the community. Navigating your way through college is a difficult process, but once you find your niche and a group of friends that will support you through thick and thin, it becomes substantially easier.

Honestly I think CSE 142 is a great class to take just because it can really open your mind to a new way of thinking about problems. On a different note, though, I would recommend AAS 360 with Professor Bonus. That's one of the few classes that I've genuinely enjoyed, and Bonus is probably the only professor that I've actually talked to extensively.

I wanted to be a part of this historic year! 100 years of presence on campus is such a great accomplishment for our community. Despite many struggles set in our paths, we persevere and we keep plowing through. That resilient spirit of our people, which kept us here for 100 years and will drive us for more, is worth celebrating!

I've been in Sayaw for the last two years, and loved every minute of it! I was really able to break out of my shell, make a lot of new friends, and learned so much about the Philippines that I'd never known before. I went from someone who could barely do the Electric Slide to someone who could sprint through a 45-minute set at Northwest Folklife; I have Sayaw to thank for that.

                      I really appreciated the way everyone in FASA just welcomed me in and accepted me as one of the family. Even though I was really shy and awkward my freshman year, and didn't talk all that much, people remembered my name and said hi to me whenever they saw me. To young freshman me, something as little as that meant a lot. As I got deeper into FASA, I loved the opportunities I had to learn more about our culture and our history. FASA has given me a family and a deeper appreciation of what it means to be Filipino, and I'm eternally grateful for that.

                      If I had to sum it all up, I'd say Filipinx friends and free food (the most important F's of my college experience) kept me coming back.

                      Giving back to the community that has helped me grow is very important to me. FASA sa UW gave me the opportunity to continue to develop my skills as a student and a leader while reminding me of my culture and my roots.
                      I’ve evolved so much through FASA and I wanted to foster this type of growth and kapwa through the position of Academics Chair.

1) LSJ 200 - This was the class that helped me solidify changing my major. It's also a very interactive class so it's great for fulfilling I&S credit. 2) AES 151 - For Diversity credit, I highly recommend this class. It's very discussion oriented and really help to shed light on identity and how it affects society.

                  FASA has given me immense support, encouragement, and skills in the past year. I wanted to experience the flip side and serve the community that has, in a short time, given me a home.
